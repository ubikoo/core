## core

Lightweight foundation code for physics and graphics projects. The library is
deliberately basic to ease learning and prototyping:

    core/               - math, graphics, and compute libraries.
        compute         - compute interface to OpenCL.
        graphics        - graphics interface to OpenGL.
        math            - vector, matrix, linear algebra, etc.
    empty/              - base template for a project.
    external/           - external dependencies.
    samples/            - math, graphics, and compute code samples.
        compute         - compute samples in OpenCL.
        graphics        - graphics samples in OpenGL.
        math            - math samples.

The library is used by the following projects:

    playground
    sandbox
